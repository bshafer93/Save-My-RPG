# Save My RPG Server

## Description

Save My RPG is a Desktop application that allows users to share their game saves with a group of friends. Originally built for Baulders Gate 3, this application could easily be adapted to a generic file sharing application!

## Technical Details

* Go
* PostgreSQL
* Docker
* Bunny CDN

### Code Details

* `Dockerfile.production`

## Motivation

I wanted a way for my friends and I to be able to mess with our characters while the host of the game was not available, but in truth I wanted the practice of building a app from start to finish.
